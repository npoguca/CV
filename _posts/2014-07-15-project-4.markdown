description: Idle Rabbits: Save the World is a fully 3D idle management game where you rid the Rabbit city of a virus that is inflicting the landscape and characters. 
This project posed a few interesting challenges like an optimized dynamically sorted World Screen UI, a dynamically changing path graph, custom shaders/texture maps generated from tiles to seamlessly animate visual terrain transformation, all of which I got to work on. I successfully aided in the publication of this project.
