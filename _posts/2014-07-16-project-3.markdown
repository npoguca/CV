description: My Idle Farm is a 2D management simulator with quaint graphics, animated characters and addictive gameplay and the first idle game Iâ€™ve worked on. For some time I was mostly occupied with UI and controls, but quickly accrued more responsibility and started working on crucial features like purchases, analytics and core mechanics.
