description: While working for Azur Interactive Games, I took part in development of PIXEL'S UNKNOWN BATTLEGROUND. This is a battle royale game, featuring a sprawling map, drivable vehicles and a variety of loot and weapons, all created in the voxel visual style. 
I was responsible for new UI design implementation, IAP modifications, loot box functionality, and significant optimization.
